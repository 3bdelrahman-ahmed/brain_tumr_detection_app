# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Detection App

A cross-platform mobile application that uses deep learning techniques to detect brain tumors from MRI scans. Built with **Flutter**, this app provides an intuitive user interface and integrates a trained model for accurate predictions.

## ðŸ“± Features

- Upload brain MRI images for real-time analysis
- Predicts presence of tumor using a pre-trained model
- Multi-platform support: Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Simple, clean, and responsive UI using Flutter

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- Dart (comes with Flutter)
- Git
- Android Studio or Xcode for mobile emulation (depending on your platform)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/3bdelrahman-ahmed/brain_tumr_detection_app.git

# Navigate to the project folder
cd brain_tumr_detection_app

# Install Flutter dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the app
flutter run

ðŸ§ª How It Works
User uploads an MRI brain scan via the app interface.

The app preprocesses the image and feeds it to a pre-trained deep learning model.

The model predicts whether the image contains a tumor.

The result is displayed to the user in a clear and simple format.

ðŸ§  Model Details
The app currently uses a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model for on-device inference. You can replace the model with your own by placing it in the appropriate assets folder and updating the inference logic.****
